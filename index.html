        <h1>CODING</h1>
        <p>Computer programming or coding is the composition of sequences of instructions, called programs, that computers can
        follow to perform tasks.[1][2] It involves designing and implementing algorithms, step-by-step specifications of
        procedures, by writing code in one or more programming languages. Programmers typically use high-level programming
        languages that are more easily intelligible to humans than machine code, which is directly executed by the central
        processing unit. Proficient programming usually requires expertise in several different subjects, including knowledge of
        the application domain, details of programming languages and generic code libraries, specialized algorithms, and formal
        logic.
        
        Auxiliary tasks accompanying and related to programming include analyzing requirements, testing, debugging
        (investigating and fixing problems), implementation of build systems, and management of derived artifacts, such as
        programs' machine code. While these are sometimes considered programming, often the term software development is used
        for this larger overall process â€“ with the terms programming, implementation, and coding reserved for the writing and
        editing of code per se. Sometimes software development is known as software engineering, especially when it employs
        formal methods or follows an engineering design process.</p>

        <h1>GAMING</h1>
        <p>A video game,sometimes more specifically computer game or more ambiguously just game, is an electronic game that
        involves interaction with a user interface or input device (such as a joystick, controller, keyboard, or motion sensing
        device) to affect computation and data access processing game logic as part of a simulation to ultimately generate
        visual feedback from a display device, most commonly shown in a video format on a television set, computer monitor,
        flat-panel display or touchscreen on handheld devices, or a virtual reality headset. Sections of interaction may be
        interspersed with non-interactive (usually story-based) portions (e.g., cutscenes). Most modern video games are
        audiovisual, with audio complement delivered through speakers or headphones, and sometimes also with other types of
        sensory feedback (e.g., haptic technology that provides tactile sensations). Some online video games also allow
        microphone and webcam inputs for in-game chatting and livestreaming.</p>

        <h1>EDITING</h1>
        <p>Editing is the process of selecting and preparing written, visual, audible, or cinematic material used by a person or an
        entity to convey a message or information. The editing process can involve correction, condensation, organization, and
        many other modifications performed with an intention of producing a correct, consistent, accurate and complete piece of
        work.</p>

        <h1>BLOGGING</h1>
        <p>A blog (a truncation of "weblog")[1] is an informational website consisting of discrete, often informal diary-style text
        entries (posts). Posts are typically displayed in reverse chronological order so that the most recent post appears
        first, at the top of the web page. In the 2000s, blogs were often the work of a single individual, occasionally of a
        small group, and often covered a single subject or topic. In the 2010s, "multi-author blogs" (MABs) emerged, featuring
        the writing of multiple authors and sometimes professionally edited. MABs from newspapers, other media outlets,
        universities, think tanks, advocacy groups, and similar institutions account for an increasing quantity of blog traffic.
        The rise of Twitter and other "microblogging" systems helps integrate MABs and single-author blogs into the news media.
        Blog can also be used as a verb, meaning to maintain or add content to a blog.</p>
